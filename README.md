# Pagination in Reactjs
- Pagination is really useful utility in the situation where user interface have to fetch & display a lot of data from an API
- Directly displaying all the fetched data would cause majorly 2 problems:
  - It would ruin the user experience & user might get lost into the pool of data
  - There is a high chance of our website to get bloated by fetching excessive data
- The above two problem can be solved by implementing pagination
- ***Pagination** is all about **fetching & displaying** data in smaller chunks across various pages*
