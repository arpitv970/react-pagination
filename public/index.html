      content="- Pagination is really useful utility in the situation where user interface have to fetch & display a lot of data from an API
      - Directly displaying all the fetched data would cause majorly 2 problems:
        - It would ruin the user experience & user might get lost into the pool of data
        - There is a high chance of our website to get bloated by fetching excessive data
      - The above two problem can be solved by implementing pagination
      - ***Pagination** is all about **fetching & displaying** data in smaller chunks across various pages*"

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
